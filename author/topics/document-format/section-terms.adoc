= Terms

== Defining Terms: the "`Terms and definitions`" section

=== Grammar summary

"`Terms and definitions`" sections follow a strict grammar
reflected in their Metanorma AsciiDoc markup:

* The term is given as a *subheading* at the appropriate level
  (three equal signs, unless there are subsections in the Terms and Definition
  section). The term may be cross-referenced from other terms, in which case it
  should have an *anchor*.

* The term is optionally followed by *alternative/admitted terms*,
  which must be marked up in an `+alt:[...]+` macro;
  *deprecated terms*, which must be marked up in a `+deprecated:[...]+` macro;
  and a term *domain*, which must be marked up in a `+domain:[...]+` macro.

* The *definition* of the term is given in a separate paragraph.

* The definition is optionally followed by *examples*
  (paragraphs with an `[example]` style attribute).

* The definition is then optionally followed by *notes* (denoted with a `NOTE:`
  prefix).

* The definition is then followed by a *citation* for the term
  (marked with a `[.source]` role attribute).

* The citation is a cross-reference to a normative reference,
  optionally followed by a comma and a modification if applicable.
  If the comma is used on its own, then the term will be shown as modified,
  with no specific modification.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
=== instant

point on the term:[time axis]

NOTE: An instantaneous event occurs at a specific instant.

[.source]
<<IEV,clause "113-01-08">>
----

renders as

.Example of a single term.
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-instant.png[Example of a single term]

NOTE: An unmodified term and definition does not require any text after
the source reference.

More complex concepts can also be specified, with alternative terms,
deprecated terms, domain, examples and a definition modified
from its original source.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[paddy]]
=== paddy
alt:[paddy rice]
alt:[rough rice]
deprecated:[cargo rice]
domain:[rice]

rice retaining its husk after threshing

[example]
Foreign seeds, husks, bran, sand, dust.

NOTE: The starch of waxy rice consists almost entirely of amylopectin.
The kernels have a tendency to stick together after cooking.

[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>, The term "cargo rice" is shown as deprecated,
and Note 1 to entry is not included here.
--

renders as

.Example of a single term with elaborated specifications
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-paddy.png[Example of a single term with elaborated specifications]

A trailing comma after the source reference can indicate that the
term or definition was "`modified`", but with no further detail:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,
--

renders as

.Example of a single source tagged as "`modified`".
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-single-source.png[Example of a single source tagged as modified]

A term and definition can be sourced from multiple sources (in accordance with
ISO 10241-1). In this case each source should be entered in a separate
`[.source]` paragraph.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,

[.source]
<<ISO7302,section 3.10>>,
--


The requirement that the source of a term be given in a citation also applies
when the source is a termbase, such as the
http://www.electropedia.org[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)].
Formally, IEV references should be cited as `IEC 60050-nnn:20xx`, where `n` is
the top-level clause, and `20xx` is the year when that particular specification
was published.

EXAMPLE: "`IEC 60050-113:2011, 113-01-07`".


In some cases,
like link:https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:2382:ed-1:v1:en[ISO/IEC 2382],
terminological clauses are numbered as plain numbers
without character separators (dashes or periods).

In the ISO world, terminological entries are technically identified
by identifiers, not clauses.
However, when the location is cited as a number, Metanorma will consider
the location a top-level clause, which will be represented in the
ISO style "`Clause X`", instead of the desired "`X`".

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO2382,clause 2121372>>, Notes to entry and accepted term "`computer program`" have been omitted.
--

In this case, we will have to apply additional markup to indicate
the number is not a top-level clause using the `droploc%` flag.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO2382,droploc%clause 2121372>>, Notes to entry and accepted term "`computer program`" have been omitted.
--

`droploc%` serves as an indication for Metanorma not to prepend
the number with the location type of "`Clause`".


=== Predefined text / Boilerplate

==== Appending to predefined text

The "`terms and definitions`" clause is often prefixed with
predefined text ("`predefined text`") automatically before any terms are
listed.

Such predefined text typically serve the following purposes:

* indicate provenance of definitions (see <<source>>); and
* provide the location where definitions may be consulted,
  depending on the flavour.

EXAMPLE: For ISO documents, a reference to the ISO Online
Browsing Platform and to the IEC Electropedia is provided in
the predefined text.

Any paragraphs or lists in the input before the first term
are appended to the flavour's defined predefined text, in the
intermediate XML format [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0]. [The
behaviour until that release was for any such text to be overwritten by the flavour's defined predefined text.]

In the following example the Metanorma ISO flavor is used
to demonstrate the behavior.

Input:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

This is some random text I have inserted in this document.

* It does not follow ISO requirements
* Nor does it follow IEC requirements

=== Term 1
--

In the rendering, the text between the title and the first
term definition is appended to the predefined text required by ISO:

____
*3. Terms and definitions*

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in
standardization at the following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at http://www.iso.org/obp[]
* IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org[]

This is some random text I have inserted in this document.

* It does not follow ISO requirements
* Nor does it follow IEC requirements

*3.1 Term 1*
____

==== Overriding predefined text

If there are no terms and definitions from the document,
no terms should be included in the clause body (it should be blank).
The predefined text at the start of the clause is adjusted to
reflect both possibilities.

In order to replace (override) the predefined text with custom
content, an initial subclause with the style attribute
`[.boilerplate]` can be used to do
so [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

Input:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
=== My predefined text (<<<=== this will be stripped)

This is predefined text that overwrites the default.

* No, it does not follow ISO requirements
* And no, it does not follow IEC requirements either

=== Term 1
--

Where:

* The title of the predefined text clause will be stripped (so you could equally
  use `=== {blank}`);

* The custom predefined text is encoded as a subclause, so that
  its extent can be made unambiguous in initial processing.

The example above will be rendered as:

____
*3. Terms and definitions*

This is predefined text that overwrites the default.

* No, it does not follow ISO requirements
* And no, it does not follow IEC requirements either

*3.1 Term 1*
____


==== Emptying predefined text

If you want to prevent the default predefined text from
appearing, you can do so by providing an empty
predefined text subclause.

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
=== {blank}

=== Term 1
--


=== Grouping IEV references

For convenience, Metanorma requires all IEV references to be to a single
reference, named `IEV` in the normative references. During the rendering of
Metanorma AsciiDoc into Metanorma XML, this reference will be replaced by the
various required "`IEC 60050-nnn:20xx`" references.

NOTE: That means that you should not insert your own instances of IEC 60050
references for IEV citations; they will be duplicated by the automatically
generated references.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>

...

[bibliography]
* [[[ievtermbank,IEV]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
// will be excluded from HTML and Word output. Will be replaced by a canonical reference in XML output.
--

Note that, for IEV entries to be validated, the IEV reference must be given as a Clause,
and in quotes (otherwise the locality syntax would be interpreted as a range);
so `\<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>` for IEV 103-01-02.

=== Title

A Terms and Definitions clause will be recognized if either _Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms_
or _Terms and definitions_ is given as the title,
regardless of case.


[[source]]
=== Source

If the Terms and Definitions of a standard are partly or fully sourced from
another standard, that standard is cited in a “source” attribute to the section:
e.g., `source=STANDARD_IDENTIFIER`, where standard identifier
is the reference anchor of the cited standard as given under the Normative
References.
(The attribute needs to be applied to the top-level clause, if there are subclauses.)

Any predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section is adjusted accordingly.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[source=ISO712]
== Terms and Definitions
--

renders as

.Illustration of predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with a single source ("`ISO 712`").
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-boilerplate-single-source.png[Illustration of predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with a single source ("ISO 712")]

Multiple sources are allowed, and need to be quoted and comma-delimited:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[source="ISO712,ISO24333"]
== Terms and Definitions
--

which renders as

.Illustration of predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with two sources ("`ISO 712 and ISO 24333:2009`").
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-boilerplate-multiple-sources.png[Illustration of predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with two sources]

=== Markup within term macros

The macros `+alt:[...]+`, `+deprecated:[...]+` and `+domain:[...]+`
can contain their own markup.

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== paddy
alt:[_paddy_ rice]
deprecated:[[smallcap]#cargo# rice]
domain:[rice]

term:[rice] from which the husk only has been removed
--

==== Stem expressions

AsciiDoc does not permit macros to be nested inside other macros.

Therefore the following markup which introduces a stem expression
as an admitted term, is considered illegal.

NOTE: The use of stem expressions as preferred terms is not a problem,
because the macro appears as a header.

[source,asciidoc]
.Bad example
--
=== stem:[t_90]
alt:[stem:[t_A]]

Time to launch.
--

However, Metanorma will treat any standalone paragraph in a term section,
consisting of just a stem macro, as an admitted term:

[source,asciidoc]
.Good example
--
=== stem:[t_90]

stem:[t_A]

Time to launch.
--

.Illustration of a term that uses stem expressions.
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-stem.png[Illustration of a term that uses stem expressions]

=== Subclauses

Any clause within a "`Terms & Definitions`" section which is a non-terminal
subclause (has child nodes) is automatically considered a terms (or definitions)
section. On the other hand, any descendant of a `nonterm` clause is also a
`nonterm` clause.

Informative clauses are indicated with the attribute `[obligation=informative]`;
clauses are normative by default.

==== Introductory non-term section

All terminal subclauses of a term section (i.e. clauses that have no subclauses
of their own) are treated as term definitions.

We have already seen one exception to this, in `[.boilerplate]` clauses. More
generally, an introductory section can be treated as a subclause instead of a
term (and will retain its status as a subclause), by prefixing it with the style
attribute `[.nonterm]`:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Terms from ISO 10303-1

For the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, the following terms
from ISO 10303-1 apply:

* integrated resource

[.nonterm]
=== Terms from ISO 10303-11

For the purposes of this document, the following terms from
ISO 10303-11 apply.

* entity;
* entity data type;
--

.Inclusion of non-term subclauses using the `[.nonterm]` attribute
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-non-clause-section.png[Inclusion of non-term subclauses]

The `[.nonterm]` attribute must only be used in subclauses that do
not contain any terms underneath (like the example above).
Otherwise, these terms will not be processed following the
corresponding formatting rules.

[example]
======
EXAMPLE: If the `[.nonterm]` attribute is applied to a
term-containing subclause, the wrong rendering will occur:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Terms from ISO 10303-1

For the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, the following terms
from ISO 10303-1 apply:

==== actual function range
mathematical space containing precisely the tuples of outputs from
the function which are related to some tuple of inputs
----

[[citeterms]]
== Referencing concepts

=== General

Instances of terms or symbols/abbreviations used in the document can be marked up to indicate the
semantic meaning of the concept.
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.14].

This can be done whether the concept is defined:

* in the current document;
* in an external, cited document; or
* in an external termbase.

Marking up mentions of concepts (terms, symbols, or abbreviations) in the content body
generally does not impact their
rendering. This tagging is intended for semantic processing of standards
documents in Metanorma Semantic XML.

Marking up term instances in "`terms and definitions`" clauses may cause terms
to render differently in certain flavors, such as for ISO and IEC, in order
to display location of where those concepts are defined.

NOTE: The syntax for citing terms has been changed for v1.10.0.
This section describes the current syntax
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.0].

The generic syntax is shown here.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}
----

In this full form of the syntax, only the `term` argument is mandatory.

All of the following variants below are supported:

[source,adoc]
----
{{term}}                // or synonym: term:[term]
// Used if the concept is defined in the current document.

{{term,display-text}}   // or synonym: term:[term,display-text]
// Used if the concept is defined in the current document, and the desired
// display text differs from the concept term.

{{term,display-text,cross-reference}}
{{term,display-text,cross-reference,options="..."}}

{{<<identifier>>,term}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}
----

* `identifier`: an identifier for the term being cited (optional).

* `term`: the term cited, in its canonical form (mandatory).

* `display-text`: text to be displayed, if it is distinct from the cited term
(optional). If this argument is not provided, the canonical form and the display
text are assumed to be identical.

* `cross-reference-text`: text to display for the cross-reference to the concept
definition (optional). If this argument is not provided, the default rendering
of the cross-reference for the current Metanorma flavour is provided.

* `options`: options that determine how the concept is to be displayed (may be
flavour-specific).

NOTE: The `{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference,options=".."}}`
markup closely mirrors the markup syntax of cross-references in Metanorma
AsciiDoc (`\<<anchor,%option,text>>`).

Instances of cited terms are converted into a distinct `concept` element in
Metanorma Semantic XML, which includes a cross-reference to the term definition,
the canonical form of the term name, and the text to be displayed for the term
in that instance.


=== Concepts defined within current document

==== Reference by term

To cite a concept defined within a document the following syntax can be used.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
// The term is from the current document as a concept.
{{term}}
// or synonym:
term:[term]

// If the desired display text differs from the concept term.
{{term,display-text}}
// or synonym:
term:[term,display-text]

// If a specific version of the cross-reference text is required.
{{term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

NOTE: Metanorma automatically creates anchor references for every concept
from the document, which is used when referencing by term.


EXAMPLE (ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 (2020), 16.5.10):

====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== terminological data
....

=== concept
...

=== terminological entry

part of a terminological data collection which contains the
{{terminological data}} related to one {{concept}}

// equivalent:
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
term:[terminological data] related to one term:[concept]
----
====

This will be displayed according to the flavour; the rendering typically contains the term text,
and a cross-reference to its definition. Any hyperlinking is done on the cross-reference.
The default Metanorma rendering would look like:

____
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
_terminological data_ [term defined in Clause 3.1] related to one _concept_ [term defined in Clause 3.2]
____

In the ISO flavour of Metanorma, and flavours derived from it, the rendering follows ISO conventions:

____
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
_terminological data_ (3.1) related to one _concept_ (3.2)
____

In some cases, the displayed term is a variant of the referenced term, such as
its plural form. That means that the display text needs to be differentiated
from the referenced term.

EXAMPLE (ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5):

[source,adoc]
----
===== instant
...

===== time axis
...

===== time scale

system of ordered marks which can be attributed to {{instant, instants}} on the
{{time axis}}, one instant being chosen as the origin

// equivalent:

system of ordered marks which can be attributed to term:[instant, instants] on
the term:[time axis], one instant being chosen as the origin
----

In the rendering, the display text is used instead of the referenced term:

____
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to _instants_ (3.7) on
the _time axis_ (3.9), one instant being chosen as the origin
____

It is conceivable that authors will want to override the automatically generated crossreference
text with their own text, as is already possible for crossreferences within Metanorma.
This requires an expanded version of the expression:

[source,adoc]
----
===== instant
...

===== time axis
...

===== time scale

system of ordered marks which can be attributed to {{instant, instants}} on the
{{time axis,time axis,see the preceding discussion}}, one instant being chosen as the origin
----

Renders into:

____
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to _instants_ (3.7) on
the _time axis_ (see the preceding discussion), one instant being chosen as the origin
____


[NOTE]
--
The terms reference capability relies on automatically created anchor
references for every term defined.

For example, in the following text,

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions
=== Foo

bar

=== Lor

special kind of term:[foo]
----

the anchors `\[[term-foo]]` and `\[[term-lor]]` are automatically created and
assigned to the terms 'foo` and `lor`.

These anchors are generated from the terms themselves according to these rules:

* the terms are lowercased;
* non-ASCII characters are stripped;
* whitespaces are replaced by `-`.

This means if you wanted to refer to a particular term from body text, you could either:

* directly refer to the term: e.g., `see definition of term:[foo]`
* refer to the anchor of the term: e.g., `the topic is further explained in \<<term-foo>>`

In case you have created manual anchors that conflict with `[[term-{X}]]`, the
term reference mechanism is smart enough to rename the generated anchor as
`[[term-{X}-{n}]]`, where `n` is a number from 1, and so forth.

Therefore this will still work as expected:

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions
=== Foo

bar

=== Lor

special kind of term:[foo]


[[term-foo]]
== My section

lorem
----
--

==== Reference by symbol

Symbols and abbreviations defined in the document can also be cited as 
concepts [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1].
In the case of symbols and abbreviations, the `symbol:[]` macro is used instead of
`term:[]`, and targets a symbol defined in a definition list within a Symbols & Abbreviations section.
Such symbols have automatic anchors assigned to them, as with terms, but prefixed with
`symbol-` rather than `term-`. If the `{{...}}` format is used instead, either a term or
a symbol is matched; terms are matched by default.

[source,adoc]
----
== Symbols and abbreviated terms
ISO:: International Standards Organization // automatically assigned the anchor symbol-ISO
[[xyz]]IEC:: International Electrotechnical Commission // is assigned the anchor xyz

== Discussion
The vocabulary is authorised by {{ISO}} and {{IEC,the IEC}}.

// equivalent

The vocabulary is authorised by symbol:[ISO] and symbol:[IEC,the IEC].
----

Unlike terms, symbols and abbreviations are not italicised, referenced, or hyperlinked by default.

____
The vocabulary is authorised by ISO and IEC.
____


==== Reference by anchor

In certain cases it is more appropriate to reference a concept (defined
in the current document) by anchor, instead of by term, e.g.:

* the defined term is not plain text, e.g., a math formula;
* the defined term is long in length.

To reference a concept by anchor, the anchor of the concept should be provided,
and optionally the text to be displayed. The anchor must be given in angle
brackets, like a normal cross-reference in Metanorma AsciiDoc.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* anchor of the concept;
* (optional) text to be displayed.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
// The concept is from the current document, but a manual anchor has been
// created for referencing it as a shorthand, useful in the case where a
// concept term is not in plain text (e.g. MathML).
{{<<identifier>>}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term, referred through
// an anchor.
{{<<identifier>>,display-text}}
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[[immatk]]
=== immature kernel
alt:[unripe kernel]

kernel, whole or broken, which is unripe and/or underdeveloped

== Discussion
The source of the {{<<immatk>>,immature kernel}} has not yet been identified.
Allusions to {{<<immatk>>,unripe kernels,immature kernel}} are plentiful in
the literature.
--


=== Concepts from external documents

To refer to concepts from an external document requires a corresponding
bibliographic anchor for that document. The identifier for the concept
is then given in the same fashion as any citation of an external document.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* bibliographic anchor of the external document, optionally including the
  locality of the term definition in that document;
* concept term name;
* (optional) text to be displayed;
* (optional) cross-reference text to be displayed.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
// The concept is from the current document but a manual anchor has been
// created for referencing it as a shorthand, useful in the case where a
// concept term is not in plain text (e.g. MathML).
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term, referred through
// an anchor.
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term,display-text}}

// If the cross-reference text for the external document needs to be overriden.
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative References
* [[[iso17301,ISO 17301]]] Cereals and pulses -- Specifications and test methods -- Rice

== Discussion
The source of the {{<<iso17301>>,immature kernel}} has not yet been identified.
Allusions to {{<<iso17301>>,immature kernel,unripe kernels}} are plentiful in
the literature.
--

In Metanorma, this will be displayed by default as:

____
The source of the _immature kernel_ [term defined in ISO 17301] has not yet been identified.
Allusions to _unripe kernels_ [term defined in ISO 17301] are plentiful in
the literature.
____

NOTE: Metanorma Semantic XML preserves the information that the latter term is
cited as _unripe kernels_, but is defined as _immature kernel_. However by
default, only the display text is rendered.

To supplement the concept reference with a locality, the `bibliographic-anchor`
element can be supplemented by a comma-delimited list of
link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography#localities[localities and locality values],
as is normal for a reference to a locality in an external document.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<bibliographic-anchor,locality=X>>,term}}

// Simple example:
{{<<iso639-1,clause=3.1>>,language}}

// If the display text differs from the cited term:
{{<<bibliographic-anchor,locality1=X>>,term,display-text}}

// Multiple localities can be used:
{{<<bibliographic-anchor,clause=4.7,table=1>>,display-text}}
----


EXAMPLE:

identified. Allusions to {{<<iso17301>>,clause=3.9,unripe kernels,immature

----

In Metanorma, this will be displayed by default as:

____
The source of the _immature kernel_ [term defined in ISO 17301, Clause 3.9] has not yet been identified.
Allusions to _unripe kernels_ [term defined in ISO 17301, Clause 3.9] are plentiful in
the literature.
____
====


=== Concepts from external termbase

To refer to a concept from an external termbase, the termbase
identifier and the concept identifier within that termbase are needed.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* termbase identifier;
* concept identifier within that termbase;
* (optional) text to be displayed for the term;
* (optional) text to be displayed for the termbase reference.

NOTE: The presence of a colon identifies the first argument in a term citation
as identifying an external termbase term, since colons are not permitted in
cross-references or bibliographic anchors.

NOTE: Termbase identifiers are treated as special anchors, they do not need
to be defined using a bibliographic reference anchor.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term.
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term,display-text}}

// If the text of the cross-reference to the termbase needs to be overridden.
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

NOTE: The termbase does not require a corresponding reference in the
bibliography.

Currently, only the IEC Electropedia (IEV) is supported, where the
reference syntax is `<<IEV:{IEV concept ID}>>`.

[source,adoc]

// Not necessary to define the IEV bibliographic anchor.

{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,text,display-term}}

// If the IEV citation text differs from the flavour default.

=== Rendering options

The following rendering options are defined for concepts.

`noital`:: do not italicise the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]
`noref`:: do not give a reference for the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]
`ital`:: do italicise the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]
`ref`:: do give a reference for the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]

If these options are missing, Metanorma applies the defaults for the current flavour. The default behaviour in
Metanorma is `ital,ref` for all terms, `noital,noref` for acronyms. In ISO, the default behaviour for terms is refined:
`noital,noref` for terms outside the Terms & Definitions section; `ital,ref` for the first mention of a term within
the Terms & Definitions section; `ital,noref` for all subsequent mentions within
the Terms & Definitions section.

In flavours that customise concept rendering, these options override the behaviour of whatever the flavour implements.
