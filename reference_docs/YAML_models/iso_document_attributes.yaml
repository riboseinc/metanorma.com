    description: |
      Stage code for the document status (see International harmonized stage codes). Synonym of `:status:`.
      ISO authors usually create Metanorma documents at stages 00 through 40 (PWI 00., AWI, NP, WD, CD, DIS). Documents at the final stages, 50 and 60 (FDIS, PRF, IS), are created by ISO Editorial Program Managers at ISO/CS (aka ISO EPMs, ISO Editors). Authors using Metanorma are not expected to edit documents at those stages, and are not necessary in a normal submission process. These stages, however, can be used for mirroring and tracking of final stage and published standards, which many authors do.
