      The document number assigned to the OGC document (without the "`OGC`" prefix).

      The number is formulated according to the following rules:
      +
      * The final two digits of the year are used at the start of the number (`YY`).
      * A three digit number is assigned sequentially for each document in the year (`NNN`).
      * The first edition of a document has the document number `YY-NNN`; for example, `00-027` is OGC document 027 first published in 2000.
      * Minor editorial changes and corrigenda do not result in a change to the document number
      * The `YY-NNN` identifier for a document (the document number root) is maintained if the document undergoes content changes (revisions). These revisions are numbered sequentially, and are indicated with `r` followed by the revision number. So `05-020r27` is revision 27 of OGC document 020 first published in 2005. (Revision 27 may appear years later than 2005.)
      * A new major version of a document receives a new document number, including likely a new year.
