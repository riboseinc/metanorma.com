      IEC documents can be translated by IEC-CO and tagged with the `translated-from` attribute. This is used to derive the correct status code.

      The codes in the first entry form are drawn from the
      https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[ISO International Harmonized Stage Codes].

      The mapping to IEC stage codes is taken from
      https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir1-consolidatediecsup%7Bed15.0.RLV%7Den.pdf[ISO/IEC DIR 1:2019 + IEC SUP:2019, Annex SH],
      updated against the current discussion of stage codes in
      https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/processes/stage_codes.htm[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Stage Codes] and

      Following is a BPUB document in final proof (ISO stage 60, substage 00):

      [source,asciidoc]
      ----
      :docstage: 60
      :docsubstage: 00
      ----
      
      and this, is an NFDIS document that has reached approval stage, but it has been rejected, and will be returned to drafting:

      [source,asciidoc]
      ----

      Project stage abbreviation.

      An IEC project stage abbreviation code entered under `:stage:` will be recognised,
      and broken down into the corresponding ISO harmonized stage and substage codes
      shown in the table automatically.

      For example, `:stage: ACD` is equivalent to setting `:docstage: 20` and `:docsubstage: 99`.

      In the case of A2CD... A9CD and 2CD... 9CD, the numeral value of the `:iteration:` attribute
      will also be set accordingly.

      For example, `:stage: 8CD` is equivalent to setting `:docstage: 35`, `:docsubstage: 20` and `:iteration: 8`.
